We designed a calculator that helps in solving complex calculations and this calculator has mainly 4 features 
1. It calculates the investment that is, how much interest we earned after investing a specific amount.
2. Debt payoff estimate, means that in how many weeks or months we can clear our loan.
3. It helps in calculating the EMI monthly,weekly.
All these features inculde calculations based on simple as well as compund ineterst that is, there is a kind of select options used between simple and compund ineterst.
4. This fourth feature calcultes the currency that is, exchnage rate between some countries.

Goal
Provide a comprehensive yet lightweight financial toolset.
Ensure accurate calculations and responsive UX.
Buld modular, maintainable, and user-friendly code.

Challanges Fcaed
we faced some challenges like:- 
1. Running the calulations using both simple and compund inetersts that is, providing options to select between simple and compund ineterst and performing calculations based on them.
2. Currency failure problems due to API downtime or finding a perfect api which inculde a considerable amount of countries as some api's support different countries as we are expecting to put in the calculator, so that was the problem we faced in currency exchange feature.
3. Sometimes the formula was true but due to javascript syntax errors the working stops and have to look again and again in formulas and the code.
4. researching and understaning the formula or the calculation we used in the backend as that things are somewhat complex.

Future Improvements
1. Adding visual charts or graphs for investment and debt-payoff features.
2. Allow exporting of results in the form of pdf's with every single thing explanation.
3. More enchnacements in the UI for example, adding dark mode feature, and many more.
4. Adding on more features that comes into daily life of individuals.
